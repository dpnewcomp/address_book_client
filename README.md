    - Server.js server needs to be written + compression
    - Webpack.config.js needs to be defined (bundle.js)
    - Webpack-build command needs to be defined (gzip)
    - Tests should be written if production deploy
    

- Cloud Deploy 
    - Project must be created on Google Cloud Platform
    - All necessary cloud build APIs need to be enabled
    - Google Cloud CLI must be downloaded + authenticated
    - Google Cloud CLI must be opened and the following steps taken:
        - GCLOUD CONFIG SET PROJECT {X}

#Assignment Summary
- Single page application developed in React
- Material UI library used 
- Flexbox used to center | center 'contact list'
- When initially loading a 'circularProgress' icon is shown until contacts exist
- Dynamically loads 4 random contacts and at list level displays their full name 
- Once contacts are loaded interactive list each name can be clicked
- Once you click a contact name the 'dialog / modal' menu pop-ups and displays the contacts (name, email, cell, location, & portrait image)
- Given more time I would make the person1, person2 states less static and more dynamic so that it could handle as many contacts as we want and we would not have to declare each and every contact
